Functionality notes:
Needs doing:
            Archive Old events (30+ days old) (delete old practices/matches, keep old tournaments/events)
            Filter specific to admins to show archived events/tournaments
            Filter specific to admins to show ALL events (all current + archived)?

            Remember Me button on login
            Forgot password button on login

            Show next community event if next_scheduled_community_event or if general event has game attached to it
            Scheduled_events do not generate properly when making a schedule rn.
            Allow editing match scores as soon as event-start-time passes, not event-end-time.
            Organize teams in teams sidebar by game, not by most recently created. Should follow same order as community order in communities tab

            Organizing Files (Done):
            all css
