Functionality notes:
Needs doing:
            Archive Old events (30+ days old) (delete old practices/matches, keep old tournaments/events)
            Filter specific to admins to show archived events/tournaments
            Filter specific to admins to show ALL events (all current + archived)?

            Remember Me button on login
            Forgot password button on login

            Allow editing match scores as soon as event-start-time passes, not event-end-time.
            Adjust format for teams folders (titles too long cause issues)
            Games with one team should not be collapsable (icon doesn't appear)
