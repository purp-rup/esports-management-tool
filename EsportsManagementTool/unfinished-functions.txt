Functionality notes:
Needs doing:
            Archive Old events (30+ days old) (delete old practices/matches, keep old tournaments/events)
            Filter specific to admins to show archived events/tournaments
            Filter specific to admins to show ALL events (all current + archived)?

            Assigning a GM not in a community does NOT automatically make them a community member/GM
            GM for multiple games cannot schedule events for all but first assigned game
