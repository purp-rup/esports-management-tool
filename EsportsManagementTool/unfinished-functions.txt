Functionality notes:
Needs doing:
            Archive Old events (30+ days old) (delete old practices/matches, keep old tournaments/events)
            Filter specific to admins to show archived events/tournaments
            Filter specific to admins to show ALL events (all current + archived)?

            Remember Me button on login
            Forgot password button on login

            Allow editing match scores as soon as event-start-time passes, not event-end-time.
            Edit-event modal supports only one game per event, not multiple.

            Organizing Files (remaining):
            game.js
            scheduled-events.js
            events.js
            All Py files
