## Setup
After cloning, you will need to create a virtual environment within the project to run the application. You can follow [these instructions](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/installation/#create-an-environment).
- You won't need to run the mkdir command after cloning, just right click the highlighted directory as shown in the image below > Copy Path/Reference... > Absolute Path, then continue with the cd command
