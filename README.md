## Overview
The Esports Management Tool is a software application developed for the Stockton University Esports program. The project addresses long-standing organizational and communication challenges caused by reliance on fragmented tools like Discord, Google Drive, and Google Calendar.  

This solution focuses on both the **competitive** and **community** sides of Stockton Esports:  
- On the **competitive side**, it streamlines logistical tasks such as scheduling, team management, and match preparation, helping Game Managers and players stay aligned.  
- On the **community side**, it enhances engagement through better event visibility, attendance tracking, and customizable notifications.  

By integrating existing workflows into a single, intuitive platform, the tool reduces missed deadlines, improves coordination, and strengthens both team and community operations.  

### Design
This application was developed using the Flask framework, making use of HTML, Python, and MySQL.
